        <p><i>"Humanity begins to turn Dark and Gray like a stone cold society."</i></p>

        <p>This collection of songs serves as a raw, chronological map of a profound emotional journey. It begins in the quiet echo of total loneliness, documenting the descent into a period of life so bleak it felt like an absolute void. The narrative shifts with the arrival of a girl, an encounter that initially promised light but ultimately spiraled into a labyrinth of total lies and betrayal. What remains is a haunting transition into "nightly dreams," where the music explores the surreal space between what was lost and the lingering subconscious visions that follow such a transformative heartbreak.</p>

            This production was a unique fusion of analog power and digital precision, built on the backbone of a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 4th Gen running Ubuntu 25.10. I tracked the heart of the music using my personal 15-piece Pearl Export drum set, capturing the raw energy of a massive acoustic kit, while various AI engines were leveraged to generate sophisticated vocal performances and intricate fills that complemented the live percussion.

            The entire project was helmed in <strong>Ardour</strong>, where I arranged the tracks and utilized <strong>FFMPEG</strong> via the command line to arrange the track, also add levels of bass, depth, and character to the raw inputs. To finalize the aesthetic and technical details, I designed the album artwork in <strong>GIMP</strong>, managed the metadata and ID3 tags with <strong>Kid3</strong> to ensure everything was properly categorized, and used <strong>VLC</strong> as my primary reference monitor for playback.
